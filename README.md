This is a API that's intended to be used for solving non-linear first order differential equations of the form \dot{\textbf{x}}=\textbf{f}_d(t, \textbf{x}). 
It supports various solver types such as explicit and implicit euler as well as Runge kutta and Gauss Lagrange Runge Kutta order 2, 4 and 6.

No AI was used in the creation of this file.
It's still a work in progress project. At the moment it is still rather incomplete, but I will be improving it over time. 

I would personally advise against using this to write anything at the moment, because currently everything in the api is potentially subject to change.
